Put the file, "Weekly Report.xlsx" into the same folder as the exe file.<br>

The first row of sheet 1 lists Monday to Friday (1~5).<br>
Fill what you have done every day into cells on the first sheet.<br>
No matter how many weekly reports you should submmit to your boss more than one day every week,<br>
every time you run the exe, a "result_report.xlsx" will be created for you.<br>
And the result report which collects data every day would be finally integrated into the sheet 2.<br>
Customize the program for your need !
