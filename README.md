A simple, customized weekly reporter generator

How to use
=====================

Put the file, "Weekly Report.xlsx" into the same folder as the exe file.
The first column of sheet 1 in the excel file lists project names.
And the first row of sheet 1 lists Monday to Friday (1~5).
Add what you have done every day in the first sheet.
No matter how many weekly reports you should submmit to your boss every week.
After running the exe, a "result_report.xlsx" would be created.
And the result report which collects data every day would be finally added into the sheet 2.
The program should be customized for your need !
